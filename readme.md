# Javascript Tutorial
### UP CSI's DevCamp (1st Sem, 2015)

This project has been updated since the devcamp session last 7 November 2015. If you cloned this project on your machine last session, please update it by running `git pull` in your local repository. Assets (the sprites) were taken from [spriters-resource](http://www.spriters-resource.com/).

Here are code snippets from DevCamp's js session.

You'll find basic js syntax and concepts in the `basic javascript` folder, complete with explanations. The code was provided by Marc Teves.

The `pokemon` folder includes assets, html, css, and js files for a simple pokemon game. `dom.js` shows how we can manipulate the DOM using either vanilla js or jquery. `pokebattle.js` manipulates the elements from `pokemon.html` and lets you attack your opponent pokemon while giving visual feedback. Comments have been added to explain the code so that beginners can easily understand what's going on.

Currently this does not simulate the actual game wherein both you and the opponent take turns in attacking. This requires some gamedev concepts which are outside the scope of this tutorial (and we simply can't teach this last session due to limited time). This will be left as an exercise to the interested coder; if curious, you can shoot me a message on how this can be done. I've also provided additional assets (from spriters-resource) should you want to take this a bit further.

Use the code however you wish; who knows, this could be the starting point of your javascript or gamedev career. Have fun coding!
